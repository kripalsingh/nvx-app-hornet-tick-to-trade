###  SPEED
**Time to First Slice**: How long from the time a trader makes trading decision to the time when the market reflects that decision.

**Tick to Trade**: “How fast can your EMS respond to advertised price?”

### EASE
“How agile are you at being able to change your business logic?”

**See how an application on top of the Hornet and The XPLatform a 100% Pure Jave application with no infrastructure code needed can server up trades in 10s of microsends.**
