OVERVIEW
========
This configuration is meant for running multiple servers that use direct tcp connections for messaging. 

Talon VM's broadcast the applications they are hosting as well along with the server's acceptors. In this 
way, applications can address other applications in a point to point fashion. 

The Direct binding has the advantage that there is not the additional network hop associated with
a messaging broker, but at present it doesn't support guaranteed messaging. For this reason 

TO CONFIGURE
============
This configuration assumes that you have 3 host boxes available, one for client and market and 
one each for the ems primary and backup servers. 

1.) client.conf
  a. Configure CLIENT_ACCEPTOR acceptor to use an interface on the host on which it will be run. 
  b. Market should be launched from the same server as the client for accurate latency measurement.
  c. CPU affinity masks:
     i.  Make sure nv.enablecpuaffinitymasks=true is set (or set to false not to affinitize) 
     ii. See Cpu Affinities below. You will want to make sure that market and client are on 
         separate nodes.
          
2.) market.conf
  a. Configure MARKET_ACCEPTOR acceptor to use an interface on the host on which it will be run. 
  b. Market should be launched from the same server as the client for accurate latency measurement.
  c. CPU affinity masks: 
     i.  Make sure nv.enablecpuaffinitymasks=true is set (or set to false not to affinitize) 
     ii. See Cpu Affinities below. You will want to make sure that market and client are on 
         separate nodes. 

3.) ems1.conf
  a. Configure EMS1_ACCEPTOR acceptor to use an interface on the host on which it will be run. 
  b. Configure the store's EMS_STOREDESCRIPTOR ifAddress to use an interface on the host on 
     which it will be run (preferable one other than the acceptor above. This interface is
     used for replication between ems1 and ems2 which will discover one another to form 
     a cluster
  c. CPU affinity masks: 
     i.  Make sure nv.enablecpuaffinitymasks=true is set (or set to false not to affinitize) 
     ii. See Cpu Affinities below. You will want to make sure that market and client are on 
         separate nodes. 

4.) ems2.conf
  a. Configure EMS2_ACCEPTOR acceptor to use an interface on the host on which it will be run. 
  b. Configure the store's EMS_STOREDESCRIPTOR ifAddress to use an interface on the host on 
   which it will be run (preferable one other than the acceptor above. This interface is
   used for replication between ems1 and ems2 which will discover one another to form 
   a cluster
  c. CPU affinity masks: 
     i.  Make sure nv.enablecpuaffinitymasks=true is set (or set to false not to affinitize) 
     ii. See Cpu Affinities below. You will want to make sure that market and client are on 
         separate nodes. 
  
CPU Affinities
==============       
When running on linux, the X Platform supports affinitizing threads to a particular cpu core.

To see the cpu layout on your machine, run:
`java -cp "libs/*" com.neeve.util.UtlThread` 

Ideally, you will want to set all of the [XX] values in the conf file to use the same socket
id. For NUMA architecture machines this allows all of the threads to share main memory attached
to the same socket which reduces latency. 

Assuming that you are running client and market on the same server to record accurate
latencies, you will want to launch each on a separate cpu socket if available. 

For example given the following output:

0: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=0, threadId=0}
1: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=1, threadId=0}
2: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=2, threadId=0}
3: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=3, threadId=0}
4: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=4, threadId=0}
5: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=8, threadId=0}
6: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=9, threadId=0}
7: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=10, threadId=0}
8: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=11, threadId=0}
9: CpuInfo{socketId=0, coreId=12, threadId=0}
10: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=0, threadId=0}
11: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=1, threadId=0}
12: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=2, threadId=0}
13: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=3, threadId=0}
14: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=4, threadId=0}
15: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=8, threadId=0}
16: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=9, threadId=0}
17: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=10, threadId=0}
18: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=11, threadId=0}
19: CpuInfo{socketId=1, coreId=12, threadId=0}

You'd want to set affinities for a process to reside all on cpus 0-9 or 10-19 so that they
can share the same core. 

When you launch, you should use numactl to tell linux to allocate memory only from the socket 
to wich you've affinitized. For example if you configured market threads all to use socket 0 
run with:

numactl -m0 numactl -m0 ./market.sh direct
